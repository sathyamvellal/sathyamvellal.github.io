<p>I grew up in a time where Age of Empires was everything! You can’t find many people who haven’t played it. Many others followed suit; Empire Earth for example. But they were not like Age of Empires. Ensemble Studios (now Microsoft Studios) did revolutionize the real-time strategy genre of computer games.
The question is, how many who played have actually bought it?</p>
