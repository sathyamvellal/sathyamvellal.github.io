<p>Yes. Thatâ€™s how long itâ€™s been since last I wrote. Not that I wasnâ€™t interested or anything, I had a lot of work! My final year project and my internship at PayPal, eBayInc. It wasnâ€™t easy. Going to work in the morning and coming back to work on the college project. Phew! My college projectâ€™s done and its my last week of internship now, ending on June 6th. And the best part - Iâ€™m back to working on things Iâ€™ve missed since the past 6-7 months!</p>

<p>So hereâ€™s my checklist -</p>

<ol>
  <li>Working back on Boost.uBLAS. It was a really exciting project for me, during GSoC and learnt a lot. My GSoC mentors have been amazing and talking to them again brings me back to the game! Thereâ€™s a pretty neat checklist we have and itâ€™s really interesting!</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s pretty disappointing for me that I couldnâ€™t work on 0 A.D. as much. The game has changed my perceptions of coding in a significant way. I plan to get back on this soon, though not yet.</li>
  <li>PES OpenSource has had a special place in my heart since it started back in 2011 and working with the community to help other students and peers with what I know and getting them to work on open source projects will be something that Iâ€™ll be spending my time on surely.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m also finally stepping into the other dimension of my world - Music. I have pretty good setup of FL Studio and VSTs and have been learning from <a href="http://musictheory.net">Music Theory</a>. Letâ€™s see what Iâ€™m capable of by the end of the year.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are others that Iâ€™ll be spending time on but cannot discuss publicly either because itâ€™s still â€œhush hushâ€ or not yet begun. Keep an eye on this feed, itâ€™s gonna be very active from now!</p>

<p>Bye!</p>
