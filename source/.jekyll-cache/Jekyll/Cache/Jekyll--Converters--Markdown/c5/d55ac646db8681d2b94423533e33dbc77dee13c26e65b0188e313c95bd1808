<p>The write-up of my talk on <span class="latex">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</span> for beginners, as a part of <em>Tech Talk Tuesday</em>, an initiative of <a href="http://pesos.pes.edu/fb">PES OpenSource</a>. I structured my talk based on this book - <a href="http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf">The Not So Short Introduction to <span class="latex">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</span></a>. So refer this book for all details as Iâ€™ve posted the notes I made to deliver my talk.</p>
