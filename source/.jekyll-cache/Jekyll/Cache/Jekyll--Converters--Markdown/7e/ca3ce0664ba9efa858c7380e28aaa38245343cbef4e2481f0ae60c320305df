<p>Its a typical day and I’m just looking at <em>Recommended Videos</em> in my YouTube, which are usually songs/music/mixes; that’s what I listen to. So I’m there, listening to UK Piano’s new video and I find a playlist recommended for me. In that playlist is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydRAb9cwHnA&amp;list=RD03X6a9odk6b_c">Cello cover of Game of Thrones</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BreakofReaIity">BreakofReality</a>. YouTube then features <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wLfOZiAd8Y">Misty Mountains Orchestral Cover</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/">The Hobbit</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sleightlymusical">sleightlymusical</a> in my <em>Recommended for You</em> list. Now it comes! Another video recommended for me from <a href="http://thepianoguys.com/">ThePianoGuys</a>. And WOW!</p>
