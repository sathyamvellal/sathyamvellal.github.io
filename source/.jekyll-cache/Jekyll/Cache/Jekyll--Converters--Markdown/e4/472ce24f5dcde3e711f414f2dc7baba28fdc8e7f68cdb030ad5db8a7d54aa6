<p>Yes. Thatâ€™s how long itâ€™s been since last I wrote. Not that I wasnâ€™t interested or anything, I had a lot of work! My final year project and my internship at PayPal, eBayInc. It wasnâ€™t easy. Going to work in the morning and coming back to work on the college project. Phew! My college projectâ€™s done and its my last week of internship now, ending on June 6th. And the best part - Iâ€™m back to working on things Iâ€™ve missed since the past 6-7 months!</p>
