<p><a href="http://play0ad.com">0 A.D.</a> is a free and open source, historical RTS game. The concept of the game was designed in 2003 and was developed for around six years as a closed-source freeware project. In 2009 the game went open source under the GPL license and art content under CC-BY-SA. This steadily attracted a lot of contributors ranging from art designers to programmers to develop the game. Much of the development and contribution started after the project was open sourced.</p>
